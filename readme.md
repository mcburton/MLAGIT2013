# MLAGIT2013

This repository contains slides from my talk at the MLA 2013 on Git. 


The presentation can be viewed online [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GLaYbTJfYxA_wOTOi9O2Y0WnSVeO_5Iu6NZi97-GyFI/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

This repository contains copies of the presentation in PDF and PPTX.

I have also included my drawings and screenshots in the ```raw-images``` folder.
