# MLAGIT2013

This repository contains slides from my talk at the MLA 2013 on Git. 

The presentation can be viewed online [here](http://mcburton.net/MLAGIT2013). I put [PDF](https://github.com/mcburton/MLAGIT2013/blob/gh-pages/MLAGIT2013.pdf?raw=true) and [PPTX](https://github.com/mcburton/MLAGIT2013/blob/gh-pages/MLAGIT2013.pptx?raw=true) the repository for those so inclined.

I have also included my drawings and screenshots in the [raw-images](https://github.com/mcburton/MLAGIT2013/tree/gh-pages/raw-images) folder.
